# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple two-player Ping Pong game developed using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles using keyboard keys, with the goal of bouncing a ball and preventing it from passing their paddle. The first player to reach 11 points wins.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Player 1 and Player 2 use different keys to control their paddles.
- **Paddle movement**: Player 1 uses the `W` and `S` keys, while Player 2 uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
- **Ball movement**: The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom walls.
- **Score system**: Players earn points when the opponent misses the ball. The game displays the winner once the maximum score is reached.
- **Custom player names**: Players can input their names before starting the game.
